# TAXI DRIVING PROJECT

## Introduction
This is a term project for the Digital System Design course of Bogazici University.
Main aim of this project is giving a VGA output to the monitor by using a FPGA board. The correct synchronization of the VGA output is prepared for 640x800 resolution. Also the VGA output is controlled by a state machine. The state machine is controlled by the buttons on the FPGA board. The state machine is designed to be a taxi driving game with an internal taximeter. 

## Controllers
Left button: Left movement
Right button: Right movement
Up button: Up movement
Down button: Down movement
Center button: Reset the taximeter. 

## Building the Project
This project is entirely written in VHDL. It can be built by using Xilinx ISE. Also the configuration file (.ucf) is provided in the repository.
